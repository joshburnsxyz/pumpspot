## Project Status

This project is currently under-development and I am working to build a pipeline to get as much data
as I can into the database. The current plan is to build a new repo of YAML files that will be used 
to seed the database via `bin/rake db:seed`.

I welcome anyone who wishes to donate their time and effort to the project, In particular the data
compilation side of things.
